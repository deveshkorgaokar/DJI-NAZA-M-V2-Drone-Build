# ESC & Motor Calibration Notes

## Why ESC Matters with NAZA
DJI NAZA outputs specific throttle signals.
Cheap generic ESCs may not sync properly.

✅ Best: OPTO ESC (Readytosky type)

## Calibration Steps (Generic)
1. Remove props
2. Set the throttle to maximum
3. Power on the drone
4. Wait for beeps
5. Move the throttle to minimum
6. Confirm arming tones

## Test
- Motors should start equally
- No sudden stops
- No jittering
